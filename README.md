**Transform your AI conversations with privacy-first context management and seamless workflow tools.**

ChatSeed enhances your ChatGPT experience by enabling you to save conversation contexts, organize them intelligently, and bridge them across different chat sessions. Never lose important context again - all while keeping your data completely private and local.

## 🔒 Privacy-First Design

**Your data stays yours. Always.**
- ✅ **Zero external servers** - No data ever leaves your computer
- ✅ **No data collection** - We never see your conversations  
- ✅ **Local storage only** - Chrome's encrypted storage API
- ✅ **Open source transparency** - Every line of code is public
- ✅ **Full user control** - Delete contexts anytime

## 🚀 Why GitHub Distribution?

We're distributing ChatSeed directly via GitHub while our Chrome Web Store approval is pending (Google's review process can take up to 5 weeks). This gives you:

- 🛡️ **Security validation** - Automated security scanning and community review
- 🤝 **Direct feedback** - Work directly with our development team
